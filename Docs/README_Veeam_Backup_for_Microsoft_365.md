Veeam_Backup_for_Microsoft_365.ps1

📂 Location: Scripts/
📎 Type: Checkmk Local Script

📝 Description

This script is designed to monitor Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 jobs via Checkmk. It retrieves the latest backup job session and reports its status in a Checkmk-compatible format. The script ensures accurate monitoring of backup success, failures, and running states.

📊 Why Use Task Scheduler?

Instead of running this script dynamically during each Checkmk agent query, we utilize Windows Task Scheduler to execute it at predefined intervals. This approach significantly reduces the load on the Checkmk agent and improves system performance. Key benefits:

- Prevents Checkmk agent execution delays caused by script processing time.
- Ensures that the latest backup status is always available without on-demand execution.
- Reduces system resource usage by running the script only when needed.

📊 Thresholds

- **OK**: Backup job completed successfully.
- **WARNING**: Job is still running beyond expected duration.
- **CRITICAL**: Backup job failed or no recent job found.

🔢 Output Format (Checkmk Compatible)

The script outputs:

```
<<<local>>>
0 VEEAM_Job_<JobName> State: Stopped, Result: Success, Creation time: <Timestamp>, End time: <Timestamp>, Type: Backup
```

Or if the job is still running:

```
<<<local>>>
1 VEEAM_Job_<JobName> State: Running, Result: In Progress, Creation time: <Timestamp>, End time: Still Running, Type: Backup
```

📁 Placement

Place this script in:

```
C:\Scripts\Veeam_Backup_for_Microsoft_365.ps1
```

🛠️ Task Scheduler Setup

1. **Open Task Scheduler** (`taskschd.msc`).
2. **Create a new task**:
   - General: Set a meaningful name (e.g., `Checkmk_Veeam365_Backup`).
   - Triggers: Set to run every 15 minutes (or as needed).
   - Actions:
     - Start a program: `powershell.exe`
     - Arguments: `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Scripts\Veeam_Backup_for_Microsoft_365.ps1`
   - Conditions: Ensure it runs regardless of user login status.
3. **Save & Enable** the task.

📚 Requirements

- **Veeam PowerShell Module** (`Veeam.Archiver.PowerShell` must be installed and accessible).
- **Checkmk Agent** must be installed and configured to read spool files.
- **Windows Task Scheduler** must be running and executing the script periodically.

📎 Notes

- The script writes output to `C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\spool\VeeamBackup365.txt`.
- Ensure PowerShell execution policy allows script execution (`Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope LocalMachine`).
- If Checkmk does not discover the service, force an inventory update (`cmk -II <hostname>` on Checkmk server).
